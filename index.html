  <h1>Building an Audio Amplifier Stuff!</h1>
    <p>Stuff on this page is about the P3A amp. <a href = "AudioStuff/BoxAmp.html">This page is about box amps.</a></p>
    <h2>Choosing a design</h2>
  <p>I am trying to build an amplifier.  I'm not looking to design one (I am not an electronics or audio engineer),
    and so I looked on line for     good choices.  Not a lot available!  At least not much I could find that would 
    sound decent and not require more technical knowledge than I have (or was willing to learn).  I found designs 
    by <a href="http://sound.whsites.net/project3a.htm">Elliot Sound Products</a> in Australia.  After reading through
    the site I looked for reviews online--there seem to be many happy amplifier builders who use his designs!  So I 
    ordered the Printed Circuit Board (PCB) for the P3A (rev3) Amplifier.  This is an image of the board that I received:<br/><br/>

    <h2>Getting the parts</h2>
    <p>After receiving the board, I gained access to Rod Elliot's instructions for assembly, along with general amplifier
    design and creation information.  More than I expected!  This info included a bill of materials, so I started ordering
    the components.  The first items to arrive were the fuses and fuse clips:<br/><br/> <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/jMspv50Y2pWO0aOoetizzdSUSRPb7KyTxMsSB9DmTtF60Fgl8yhV0OqMZBKZCf7QQgthDjztVGI0x4SCoBHlcunaGzuoCmbF8I2JUw9r0z_dfqS9ziu5HoFnbJ4K4bcTXNiLYYbH2Q=w2400" style="width:250px;height:190px;"alt = "Fuses and Fuse Clips"></a>
    
    <div>Not too exciting, I know. But I did get to check the fit, to make sure I got the right parts. (I had a hard time figuring
  out if the fuse clips were correct from information online).  I checked, and the clips and fuses fit! Here is proof:<br/><br/>
