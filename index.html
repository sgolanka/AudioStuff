  <h1>Amplifier Stuff!</h1>
    <h2>This is about the ESP <b><u>P3A</b></u> amplifier.</h2>
  <p>I am trying to build an amplifier.  I'm not looking to design one (I am not an electronics or audio engineer),
    and so I looked on line for     good choices.  Not a lot available!  At least not much I could find that would 
    sound decent and not require more technical knowledge than I have (or was willing to learn).  I found designs 
    by <a href="http://sound.whsites.net/project3a.htm">Elliot Sound Products</a> in Australia.  After reading through
    the site I looked for reviews online--there seem to be many happy amplifier builders who use his designs!  So I 
    ordered the Printed Circuit Board (PCB) for the P3A (rev3) Amplifier.  This is an image of the board that I received:
